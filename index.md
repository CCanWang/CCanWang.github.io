## About Me

I am a Ph.D. in Computer Application Technology from <span style="color: #FF6600;">Peking University </span> and a postdoctoral fellow at <span style="color: #FF6600;">Kiel University</span> in Germany. I studied under Professor Reinhard Koch, the founder of the SFM method in the field of three-dimensional reconstruction of machine vision. He was the winner of the Maar Prize, the highest award in machine vision in 1998. In 2006, I served as a visiting scholar at <span style="color: #FF6600;">California State University (San Jose)</span> . I have collaborated with the  <span style="color: #FF6600;">China Academy of Space Technology </span> and participated in the visual reconstruction project of the lunar surface of the "Chang'e Project" lunar lander. I served as a deputy senior engineer at the Institute of Automation, <span style="color: #FF6600;">Chinese Academy of Sciences</span> , and in 2016, as the core founder, I participated in the creation of a specialized and innovative AI+ security company in Beijing. In 2018, as a <span style="color: #FF6600;"> technical partner</span>, I established a provincial-level specialized AI+ robot company in Zhejiang Province with a valuation of 1 billion within 4 years.
I have published many papers in conferences and journals such as IEEE TIP, ACM MM, IEEE TMM, ICRA, ICASSP, SPL, etc., and have authorized more than 40 national invention patents.
